# ChefSteps Joule Sous Vide — Home Assistant Integration

Control and monitor your **ChefSteps Joule** circulator directly from Home Assistant, without the ChefSteps app.

> **Status: Early-stage (v0.3).** The core integration works. Some Bluetooth characteristic UUIDs are still being confirmed against real hardware. See [Known Limitations](#known-limitations).

## What You Get

Once set up, Home Assistant creates five entities for your Joule, all under a single **ChefSteps Joule Sous Vide** device:

| Entity | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Current Temperature** | Sensor | Live water temperature in °C, updated every 30 seconds |
| **Sous Vide** | Switch | Starts and stops the cooking cycle |
| **Target Temperature** | Number | Temperature to heat to (displayed in °F or °C, default °F) |
| **Cook Time** | Number | How long to cook in minutes (0 = no time limit) |
| **Temperature Unit** | Select | Choose °F or °C for the Target Temperature display (persisted across restarts) |

---

## Requirements

- Home Assistant **2024.2** or newer
- Your HA host within **~10 metres** of the Joule (Bluetooth range)
- The Joule **powered on** and not connected to the ChefSteps app
- The Joule's **Bluetooth MAC address** (see [Finding Your MAC Address](#finding-your-mac-address))

---

## Installation

### Method 1 — HACS (recommended)

[HACS](https://hacs.xyz) is the Home Assistant Community Store. It handles installation and updates automatically.

1. Make sure [HACS is installed](https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/).
2. In Home Assistant, go to **HACS** → **Integrations**.
3. Click **⋮** → **Custom repositories**, add `https://github.com/acato/ha-joule`, category **Integration**.
4. Search for **ChefSteps Joule Sous Vide** and click **Download**.
5. **Restart Home Assistant.**

### Method 2 — Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/joule_sous_vide/` folder into the `custom_components/` directory inside your HA configuration directory.
2. **Restart Home Assistant.**

### Add the integration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **+ Add Integration**.
2. Search for **Joule** and select **ChefSteps Joule Sous Vide**.
3. Enter your Joule's Bluetooth MAC address (`AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`) and click **Submit**.

> ✅ On success, a **"Joule AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"** device appears with five entities ready to use.

## Finding Your MAC Address

**Easiest — phone app:**
1. Install a free Bluetooth scanner (iOS/Android: "nRF Connect" or "BLE Scanner").
2. Power on your Joule and open the app.
3. Scan for devices and look for one named **"Joule"**.
4. The address shown (e.g. `D4:9A:20:01:F3:8B`) is what you need.

**Linux / Raspberry Pi host:**
```bash
bluetoothctl scan on
# Wait a few seconds, find the entry named "Joule", press Ctrl+C to stop
```

## Using the Integration

**Set your temperature:** Adjust the **Target Temperature** number entity to your desired setpoint before starting. Use the **Temperature Unit** selector to choose °F or °C — your preference is saved across restarts.

**Set cook time:** Set the **Cook Time** number entity (in minutes). Leave it at 0 for no time limit.

**Start a cooking session:** Toggle the **Sous Vide** switch on. The Joule reads the current Target Temperature and Cook Time values and begins heating.

**Stop cooking:** Toggle the switch off. The Joule stops immediately.

**Monitor temperature:** The **Current Temperature** sensor updates every 30 seconds and works in dashboards, automations, and templates.

**Automate:** Use standard HA automations to schedule cooks, send alerts when the target temperature is reached, or control the Joule with a voice assistant.

```yaml
# Example: notify when the bath is up to temperature
trigger:
  - platform: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.joule_current_temperature
    above: 59.5
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app
    data:
      message: "Water bath is ready!"
```

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| **Bluetooth characteristic UUIDs** | The BLE protocol is based on [redacted] and is not fully confirmed. Control commands may not work on all firmware versions. |
| **State tracking** | The Joule's on/off state is tracked by HA, not read back from the device. If you stop the Joule from the ChefSteps app or physically unplug it, HA will not detect the change automatically. |
| **Temperature control** | Target temperature and cook time currently use fixed defaults (60 °C, unlimited). Custom values via the HA UI are planned for a future version. |
| **One connection at a time** | Bluetooth only supports one active connection. Close the ChefSteps app before using this integration. |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Entities show "Unavailable":** The Joule is out of Bluetooth range, powered off, or another app has the connection. The integration reconnects automatically once the device is available again.

**"Failed to connect" during setup:** Check the Joule is powered on, within range, and not connected to the ChefSteps app. Double-check the MAC address format (`AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` with colons, uppercase).

**Integration not appearing in the search:** Make sure the folder is named exactly `joule_sous_vide`, is inside the `custom_components/` directory, and Home Assistant was restarted after copying it.

## Road Map

These are the next planned improvements, in priority order:

### ~~1 — Set a target temperature~~ ✅ Done

Two `number` entities — **Target Temperature** and **Cook Time** (0–1440 min) — let you set cooking parameters from the dashboard or an automation. When the Sous Vide switch is turned on it reads the current values and passes them to the device. A **Temperature Unit** `select` entity (default °F) controls whether the target temperature is displayed and entered in °F or °C; the device always receives °C internally. The unit preference is persisted to the config entry and survives Home Assistant restarts.

### ~~2 — Custom Lovelace card~~ ✅ Done

A `custom:joule-sous-vide-card` Lovelace card that shows current temperature, target temperature (with +/− steppers), cook time (with +/− steppers), a °F/°C unit toggle, and a Start/Stop button — all in one panel. The card is served automatically by the integration at `/joule_sous_vide/joule-card.js`; add it as a Lovelace resource and it appears in the card picker. See [How To: Use the Custom Lovelace Card](docs/how-to-lovelace-card.md).

### ~~3 — HACS integration and install workflow~~ ✅ Done

Added `hacs.json`, a GitHub Actions release workflow (triggered by version tags, validates `manifest.json` version, publishes a zip as a GitHub Release), and a CI workflow that runs the test suite on every push. The integration can now be installed via HACS as a custom repository.
