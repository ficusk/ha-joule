# ChefSteps Joule Sous Vide — Home Assistant Integration

Control and monitor your **ChefSteps Joule** circulator directly from Home Assistant, without the ChefSteps app.

![Joule Sous Vide card](docs/images/card-screenshot.svg)

> **Status: v0.18.6 — Hardware-validated.** The integration communicates with the Joule over BLE using [redacted] protobuf messages, with application-level key exchange authentication and real-time temperature streaming. See [Known Limitations](#known-limitations) and the [Development History](#development-history) appendix.

## What You Get

Once set up, Home Assistant creates five entities for your Joule, all under a single **ChefSteps Joule Sous Vide** device:

| Entity | Type | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Current Temperature** | Sensor | Live water temperature in °C, updated every 30 seconds |
| **Sous Vide** | Switch | Starts and stops the cooking cycle |
| **Target Temperature** | Number | Temperature to heat to (displayed in °F or °C, default °F) |
| **Cook Time** | Number | How long to cook in minutes (0 = no time limit) |
| **Temperature Unit** | Select | Choose °F or °C for the Target Temperature display (persisted across restarts) |

---

## Requirements

- Home Assistant **2024.2** or newer
- Your HA host within **~10 metres** of the Joule (Bluetooth range)
- The Joule **powered on** and not connected to the ChefSteps app
- The Joule's **Bluetooth MAC address** (see [Finding Your MAC Address](#finding-your-mac-address))

---

## Installation

### Method 1 — HACS (recommended)

[HACS](https://hacs.xyz) is the Home Assistant Community Store. It handles installation and updates automatically.

1. Make sure [HACS is installed](https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/).
2. In Home Assistant, go to **HACS** → **Integrations**.
3. Click **⋮** → **Custom repositories**, add `https://github.com/acato/ha-joule`, category **Integration**.
4. Search for **ChefSteps Joule Sous Vide** and click **Download**.
5. **Restart Home Assistant.**

> The custom Lovelace card is bundled with the integration and registers itself automatically — no separate Frontend download needed. See [How To: Use the Custom Lovelace Card](docs/how-to-lovelace-card.md) for setup instructions.

### Method 2 — Manual

1. Copy the `custom_components/joule_sous_vide/` folder into the `custom_components/` directory inside your HA configuration directory.
2. **Restart Home Assistant.**

> The Lovelace card is bundled and registers itself automatically on startup.

### Add the integration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **+ Add Integration**.
2. Search for **Joule** and select **ChefSteps Joule Sous Vide**.
3. Enter your Joule's Bluetooth MAC address (`AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`) and click **Submit**.
4. **First-time only:** A notification will appear asking you to press the physical button on top of the Joule within 60 seconds. This completes the application-level key exchange. The key is saved automatically — subsequent connections won't require the button press.

> ✅ On success, a **"Joule AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"** device appears with five entities ready to use.
>
> **Tip:** If you have a valid auth key from the official app, you can import it via **Settings > Devices > Joule > Configure** to skip the button press.

## Finding Your MAC Address

**Easiest — phone app:**
1. Install a free Bluetooth scanner (iOS/Android: "nRF Connect" or "BLE Scanner").
2. Power on your Joule and open the app.
3. Scan for devices and look for one named **"Joule"**.
4. The address shown (e.g. `D4:9A:20:01:F3:8B`) is what you need.

**Linux / Raspberry Pi host:**
```bash
bluetoothctl scan on
# Wait a few seconds, find the entry named "Joule", press Ctrl+C to stop
```

## Using the Integration

**Set your temperature:** Adjust the **Target Temperature** number entity to your desired setpoint before starting. Use the **Temperature Unit** selector to choose °F or °C — your preference is saved across restarts.

**Set cook time:** Set the **Cook Time** number entity (in minutes). Leave it at 0 for no time limit.

**Start a cooking session:** Toggle the **Sous Vide** switch on. The Joule reads the current Target Temperature and Cook Time values and begins heating.

**Stop cooking:** Toggle the switch off. The Joule stops immediately.

**Monitor temperature:** The **Current Temperature** sensor updates every 30 seconds and works in dashboards, automations, and templates.

**Automate:** Use standard HA automations to schedule cooks, send alerts when the target temperature is reached, or control the Joule with a voice assistant.

```yaml
# Example: notify when the bath is up to temperature
trigger:
  - platform: numeric_state
    entity_id: sensor.joule_current_temperature
    above: 59.5
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app
    data:
      message: "Water bath is ready!"
```

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|---|---|
| **BLE-only — no cloud** | The ChefSteps cloud is shutting down (March 2026). This integration communicates exclusively over Bluetooth. WiFi/cloud control is not supported. |
| **First-time auth requires button press** | The Joule uses application-level key exchange, not OS-level BLE pairing. On first setup, the user must press the physical button on the Joule within 60 seconds. The key is persisted and reused automatically on reconnection. Alternatively, import a key via **Settings > Devices > Joule > Configure**. |
| **BLE protocol** | The protobuf message format is [redacted] from [[redacted]](https://github.com/[redacted]/[redacted]) and iOS PacketLogger captures. Commands may not work on all firmware versions. |
| **State polling delay** | Cooking state is read from the device every 30 seconds via `program_step`. Between polls, state may be stale if the Joule is controlled from the ChefSteps app. |
| **One connection at a time** | Bluetooth only supports one active connection. Close the ChefSteps app before using this integration. |
| **ESPHome proxy support** | ESPHome Bluetooth Proxies are supported but local adapters are preferred. When connected via proxy, the integration polls for data instead of relying on notifications. |

---

## Troubleshooting

**Entities show "Unavailable":** The Joule is out of Bluetooth range, powered off, or another app has the connection. The integration reconnects automatically once the device is available again.

**"Failed to connect" during setup:** Check the Joule is powered on, within range, and not connected to the ChefSteps app. Double-check the MAC address format (`AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF` with colons, uppercase).

**Integration not appearing in the search:** Make sure the folder is named exactly `joule_sous_vide`, is inside the `custom_components/` directory, and Home Assistant was restarted after copying it.

For full troubleshooting steps, see **[docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md)**.

## Development History

This integration was built iteratively over 30+ releases and 70+ commits, [redacted] the Joule's BLE protocol from scratch. The journey included migrating BLE stacks, discovering an application-level key exchange, debugging MTU and protobuf encoding issues, and capturing the official iOS app's traffic with Apple's PacketLogger to find the final missing pieces.
